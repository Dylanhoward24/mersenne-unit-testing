# Mersenne Unit Testing

Automated Testing

=== Writing code, to test that your code works

Manual Testing

=== Clicking and poking around and seeing if it works



Benefits of testing

- Automate the manual stuff, potentiall saving time
- Risk mitigation
  - Lower the risk of deployment
  - "Safety" in programming --> better code
    - Pay down your technical debt
- Makes deployment cheater, easier, and less scary
- Dopamine rush



Costs of testing
- Takes a while to write
- Beware dogmatism
- Beware testing with purpose

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

Write tests first
Watch them fail
Fix them

Works really well if you understand the technical scope of what you're building
